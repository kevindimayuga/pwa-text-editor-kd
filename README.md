# PWA Text Editor

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

M19 - This repo is a single-page text editor application that meets PWA criteria.

## Description

The challenge is an On-the-job ticket/feature request Challenge (begin with starter code that you need to modify). The goal is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline. I will implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database.

The motivation behind this project is to learn how to build a PWA that can be used offline and online. This project will also help me learn how to use IndexedDB to store data when the application is offline.
